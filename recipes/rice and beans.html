    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and rinse both rice and beans in separate bowls to make sure all the dirt is removed before you begin to per-boil each.</li>
        <li>In separate pots per-boil both rice and beans for about 9-13 minutes to remove excess starch and preservatives on the body before removing it and draining both.</li>
        <li>In a fresh,clean and dry pot thats already on the gas on a low medium heat pour two spoons of red oil in and allow it to heat up.</li>
        <li>When the oil is properly heated up pour in your blended pepper mix and allow it to fry till the oil begins to float on the pepper(which indicates the pepper has been properly fried).</li>
        <li>When the pepper has been properly fried add your preferred Seasoning mix and taste to confirm its just as you want then let it fry for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Now go in and add a preferred amount of water to the fried blended pepper mix and allow it to boil together.</li>
        <li>Once the water begins to boil go in and add the beans first and allow that to boil for about 5 minutes(Beans first cause its naturally harder than rice and usually takes a few more minutes to get softer than rice).</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes go in and add the rice to the boiling water then mix properly so both the beans and the rice are mixed evenly, then let both boil.</li>
        <li>Before the water boils out and completely dries up taste to see if adjusting the seasoning is necessary, if not then cover back and allow the water to to completely dry out.</li>
        <li>Once dry turn off the heat and allow to simmer for a few minutes then serve.</li>
    </ol>
